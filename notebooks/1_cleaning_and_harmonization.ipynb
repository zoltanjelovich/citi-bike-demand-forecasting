    "\n",
    "Citi Bike trip data were cleaned with an emphasis on schema consistency and data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trip data were loaded using a standardized schema.\n",
    "* Column names were harmonized across vintages.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Filtering and corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "* Records with missing or invalid timestamps, station identifiers, or latitude/longitude values were removed.\n",
    "* Trip duration was computed in minutes and seconds, and implausible outliers were excluded.\n",
    "* Exact duplicate trip records were identified and removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Station master table\n",
    "\n",
    "* A canonical station master table was constructed.\n",
    "* Station locations were spatially joined to census tracts and ZIP codes.\n",
    "* Station identifier changes, relocations, and deprecations were reconciled to maintain longitudinal consistency.\n",
